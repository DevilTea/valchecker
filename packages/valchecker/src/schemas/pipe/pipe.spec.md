# pipe.spec.md

Source File: `./pipe.ts`

## Functionality Summary
- Provides a pipeline system for chaining multiple validation schemas together. Allows building complex validation workflows by composing schemas with check, transform, and fallback steps.

## Exported Items (Functions, Classes, Constants, TS Types, etc.)
- `PipeSchema`
  - Description: Main pipeline schema class that chains multiple validation schemas together
  - Input: Array of validation schemas
  - Output: Pipeline that validates input through each schema in sequence

## Test Cases (as strictly required for 100% coverage)
- `PipeSchema.execute`
  - Happy Path Cases
    - [ ] case 1: validates successfully through single step pipeline
      - Input: `value: 'test'`, pipeline with one successful schema
      - Expected: `{ value: 'test' }`
    - [ ] case 2: validates successfully through multi-step pipeline
      - Input: `value: 'test'`, pipeline with multiple successful schemas
      - Expected: `{ value: 'transformed' }`
    - [ ] case 3: handles async pipeline with successful validation
      - Input: `value: 'test'`, pipeline with async schemas
      - Expected: `Promise<{ value: 'result' }>`
    - [ ] case 4: stops at first failure in pipeline
      - Input: `value: 'invalid'`, pipeline where first schema fails
      - Expected: `{ issues: [{ code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR' }] }`
  - Edge Cases
    - [ ] case 1: handles empty pipeline (should not happen in practice)
      - Input: `value: 'test'`, empty pipeline
      - Expected: Appropriate handling
    - [ ] case 2: propagates errors from any step in pipeline
      - Input: `value: 'test'`, pipeline where middle schema fails
      - Expected: `{ issues: [{ code: 'STEP_ERROR' }] }`
    - [ ] case 3: handles mixed sync/async steps in pipeline
      - Input: `value: 'test'`, pipeline with mix of sync and async schemas
      - Expected: `Promise<{ value: 'result' }>`
- `PipeSchema.check`
  - Happy Path Cases
    - [ ] case 1: adds check step to pipeline
      - Input: Pipeline, check function
      - Expected: New pipeline with check step added
    - [ ] case 2: check step validates successfully
      - Input: Pipeline with check that passes
      - Expected: Validation continues to next step
    - [ ] case 3: check step fails validation
      - Input: Pipeline with check that fails
      - Expected: Pipeline stops with check failure
- `PipeSchema.transform`
  - Happy Path Cases
    - [ ] case 1: adds transform step to pipeline
      - Input: Pipeline, transform function
      - Expected: New pipeline with transform step added
    - [ ] case 2: transform step modifies value successfully
      - Input: Pipeline with transform that changes value
      - Expected: Next steps receive transformed value
- `PipeSchema.fallback`
  - Happy Path Cases
    - [ ] case 1: adds fallback step to pipeline
      - Input: Pipeline, fallback function
      - Expected: New pipeline with fallback step added
    - [ ] case 2: fallback executes when previous step fails
      - Input: Pipeline where fallback activates
      - Expected: Fallback value returned
    - [ ] case 3: fallback not executed when previous step succeeds
      - Input: Pipeline where fallback is not needed
      - Expected: Original value passed through
